The short-term anticipatory adaptation response is review the outcomes of domestic quota market operation. The market system of allocating quota within the UK should be reviewed to ensure it is fair, flexible and adaptive to the impacts of climate change. A fair market should be balanced with any market failure addressed that might otherwise aggravate seasonal shifts in the relative abundance and distribution of stocks. Any changes to the fleet would have knock-on effects from port infrastructure that would need to be considered, which itself is affected by Climate Change.

The long-term anticipatory adaptation response is review the management (governance) arrangements for all species. Management arrangement of species inside the TAC system and out with the TAC system (e.g., bass, tigger fish, sea bream, red mullet, squid etc.) should be reviewed to consider tow they can better reflect changed circumstances in relation to Climate Change. It is recognised that not all parts of the industry feel this is a priority adaptation response. It is also recognised that, although such a fundamental issue demands a long term horizon, external circumstances may raise this as a priority response to be activated in the short to medium term. 

Both ""Cope"" and ""Reduced Sensitivity"" was used here, as this is a mechanism to cope with the full effects of climate change, and in doing such a governance review as suggested above would reduce the sensitivity of the Climate Change stressor by focusing on those TAC species that would provide opportunity under Climate Change rather than continuing to deplete the stocks of those most impacted by Climate Change.
